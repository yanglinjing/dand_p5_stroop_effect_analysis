## Project Overview
In this project, I investigated a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect:

+ used descriptive statistics to describe qualities of a sample
+ set up a hypothesis test
+ made inferences from a sample (bootstrapping)
+ drew conclusions based on the results
